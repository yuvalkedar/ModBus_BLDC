# ModBus_BLDC

 Recently I got my hands on a BLDC motor driver (DBLS-02-S).
 Working with the terminals is pretty easy, but where is the fun in that?
 The driver also supports ModBus communication over RS485 which reduces the number of necessary wires to 2 and allows me to get more information and more control.
 The problem is I couldn't find any code example on how to use it and it's datasheet is the worst.

 The following python script allows using most of the features.
 I used [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32995858378.html) USB to RS485 module to control the driver.


 Enjoy :)
